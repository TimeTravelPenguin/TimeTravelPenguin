# Introduction

My name is Phillip, and I am currently studying a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

I have spent several years developing my skills in C#, primarily WPF.
Recently I dove into the world of functional programming, picking up F#, but especially Haskell, which has opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking and problem-solving by following a functional paradigm.
I also have a fair amount of experience with Python, having done work as a research assistant for my University's Mathematics department, working on visualising a models of higher-order relations between 4x4 vectorspaces.

I am very comfortable with LaTeX, and use it a lot in place of other simpler technologies to constantly better my skills in proper typesetting.

A final recent interest of mine is in mathematical theorem proving assistants. I have gained an interest in the language [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io), which is an increadible language, but also rather complex, and provides an environment to aid in proving propositional hypotheses, which is further aided by the community and their public library of proofs.

## Currently learning

1. Haskell
2. Abstract algebra and how it applies to the functional paradigm of programming
3. Lean math proofing assistant

## Major projects

1. I developed the [MupenSharp](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/MupenSharp) C# library, which aims to interface with Mupen64 files. The original goal of this library was to develop something other members of the online SM64 Tool-Assisted Speedrunning community can use and implement into their projects, without needing to continuously reimplement the tools to work with the binary files used by Mupen64.

2. I created the repository for the [SM64TASArchive](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/SM64TASArchive) repository, which is an organised record of Super Mario 64 Tool-Assisted Speedruns, in order to preserver the historical accuracy or development and improvements set by the community.
