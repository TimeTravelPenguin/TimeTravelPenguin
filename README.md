My name is Phillip, and I studing a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I have a decent set of skills in C# and Python.

I work in C#, primarily, with skills in WPF .NET Framework.

### Major projects

 1. I develop the [MupenSharp](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/MupenSharp) C# library, which aims to interface with Mupen64 files.
 
 2. I own the repository for the [SM64TASArchive](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/SM64TASArchive) repository, which is an organised record of Super Mario 64 Tool-Assisted Speedruns, in order to preserver the historical accuracy or development and improvements set by the community.
