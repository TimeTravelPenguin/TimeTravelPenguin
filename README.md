# Introduction

My name is Phillip, and I am currently studying a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

I have spent several years developing my skills in C#, primarily WPF.
Recently I dove into the world of functional programming, picking up F#, but especially Haskell, which has opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking and problem-solving by following a functional paradigm.
I also have a fair amount of experience with Python, having done work as a research assistant for my University's Mathematics department, working on visualising models of higher-order relations between 4x4 vector spaces.

I am very comfortable with LaTeX, and use it a lot in place of other simpler technologies to constantly better my skills in proper typesetting.

A final recent interest of mine is in mathematical theorem-proving assistants. I have gained an interest in the language [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io), which is an incredible language, but also rather complex, and provides an environment to aid in proving propositional hypotheses, which is further aided by the community and their public library of proofs.

## Major projects

1. I do a lot of $\LaTeX$ and so it was natural that I fell in love with Typst. So much so, that I decided to make [catppuccin/typst](https://github.com/catppuccin/typst) to save my poor eyes from further eye strain. I like Catppuccin, so it was a fun collaboration!

2. An application made for my own use case: [UniHs](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/UniHs). Written in Haskell, this command-line application is a remake of a Python script that served the purpose of creating new assessment directories for university courses, based on the current working directory. The primary use case is that the app finds the current course folder in the parent directory tree, looks for the assessments directory, creates a new assessment subdirectory, and copies a template folder into the directory, performing some basic editing of the newly copied file to prefill some key terms in $\LaTeX$ documents. This Haskell version is a mix between a "better version", with more options and tools, and a toy project to better get my hands on the Haskell language.

3. [BulkAudioExtractTool (BAET)](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/BulkAudioExtractTool) is a commandline tool I have developed to bulk-extract all audio tracks of a video, for all videos in a directory. Written in Python, it provides a nice interface and additional options to suit the specific task.

4. I developed the [MupenSharp](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/MupenSharp) C# library, which aims to interface with Mupen64 files. The original goal of this library was to develop something other members of the online SM64 Tool-Assisted Speedrunning community can use and implement into their projects, without needing to continuously reimplement the tools to work with the binary files used by Mupen64.

5. I created the repository for the [SM64TASArchive](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/SM64TASArchive) repository, which is an organised record of Super Mario 64 Tool-Assisted Speedruns, to preserve the historical accuracy or development and improvements set by the community.
