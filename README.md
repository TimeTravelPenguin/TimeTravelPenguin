My name is Phillip, and I studing a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I have a decent set of skills in C# and Python.

I work in C#, primarily, with skills in WPF .NET Framework and .NET 5. I also have experience with Python, having done work as a research assistant for my University's Mathematics department.

### Major projects

 1. As a university student, I work a lot in LaTeX. I found it difficult to make a lot of Tikz figures within my documents. Because of this, I decided to make a C# library that I called [TikzAutonoma](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/TikzAutonoma). It's goal is to allow a C# approach into building Tikz figures, and then have it build the correct output for the user to take and use within their documentation.

 2. I developed the [MupenSharp](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/MupenSharp) C# library, which aims to interface with Mupen64 files.
 
 3. I created the repository for the [SM64TASArchive](https://github.com/TimeTravelPenguin/SM64TASArchive) repository, which is an organised record of Super Mario 64 Tool-Assisted Speedruns, in order to preserver the historical accuracy or development and improvements set by the community.
